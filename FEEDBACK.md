# Feedback

## Good stuff

- Anna, really loved the checks on each data preprocessing step + the commenting of what you did
- Your code is easily readable, you have good names for variables, the notebook was overall well-organized, I'm very happy about your process! 

## To improve

- Remember to create the intermediate data!
- A few more comments on what you gather from the data during exploration, e.g. where is most of the data located, where do you have nulls
- To add: null handling for the rest of the variables, checking for duplicates

## For next time:
- Add a README template - I know we discussed about it and I didn't stress it, hence why it's for next time! Will post in the #general channel about it ;)
